# x360_steelerection

This is an Xbox 360 game I created in mostly 2014 for the XNA framework when the Xbox 360 Indie Game store was still a thing.  The object of the game was to stack different color and shaped blocks as densely as possible while the time was getting faster and without mixing up colors.  The game generally worked and had a failure condition.  It was complete minus some menu functionality and polishing.  Honestly it wasn't very fun though so I never attempted to polish and publish it.

I don't think I could ever get this to compile and run anymore and I no longer have the hardware to play it on, but it's interesting to archive for history sake.
